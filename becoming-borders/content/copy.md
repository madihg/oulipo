## Stories

### 1. Border-Feeling

The border is a feeling, familiar
like my funny uncle's sunday jabs.
Because I have a Lebanese passport,
I've needed a visa to step into
lands immune to my country.

### 2. Become-Border

12 years ago, when asked at the British border what I intended to do during my visit, I shared I might use my laptop to get some work done. I was refused entry into the United Kingdom. That day, my life line diverged and a new timeline set in. I became the border I did not cross that day.

### 3. Eel-Power

When I VPN my way into barred content,
incognito my way against the panopticon
walls of algorithmic triaging
into higher price brackets,
I am embracing the eel
as a power animal

### 4. Morph-Other

If real-world migrants need to erase and deny old, and reach for new, identity parts in a high-stakes combinatorial game, digital migrants conduct comparable identity operations. Sum and substract bits of cyber alter egos into a morphing otherness. Chameleon into alternatives. Become illegible to themselves.

### 5. Screen-Skin

The screen came later. First was the skin. The skin is the largest organ. The oldest magic trick: A cloak of invisibility. You have no idea. You have no idea what the skin can seal. What the skin conceals. You have no idea what wants to hide, not under, but behind it. You think the border is the wall over there. You have no idea.

### 6. Ana-Mendieta

In a retrospective of Ana Mendieta's work at the MoMA: "This exhibition points not necessarily to the injustice or incapacity of a society that has not been willing to include us, but more towards a personal will to continue being 'other.'" That it may be intentional, that we want this, the way we want a vacation or a hobby. The deepening chasm between my mother's TV congregation and my polycule's public Instagram account even though her and I hold hands for a week in Paris. Not either or. We're strangers together and my other-ness doesn't negate as much as folds each of my airborne roots.

### 7. Notice

Notice: You've been drawing
and crossing lines by yourself.
See. A landscape of self-invasions
a quilt of personal trespassings
All yours now.
