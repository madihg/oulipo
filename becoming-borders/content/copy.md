## Stories

### 1. Border-Feeling

The border is a feeling, familiar
like my funny uncle's sunday jabs
Because I have a Lebanese passport,
I've needed a visa to get into each and every country
I visited over the last few years.

### 2. Become-Border

At the British border once, when asked whether I was intending on working while in the country, I shared I might fiddle on my computer and, while holding the other end of my passport, open to the tourist visa page, was told I'd be denied entry that day, saw a year dissolve as the agent's hands let go of the other end.

### 3. Eel-Power

When I VPN my way into barred content,
when I incognito my way against the panopticon
walls of algorithmic triaging
into higher price brackets due to the country I live in,
I am embracing the eel
as a power animal

### 4. Morph-Other

If real-world migrants need to erase, deny and reach old and new identity parts in a high-stakes existential combinatorial game, digital migrants conduct comparable identity operations. Sum and substract bits of cyber alter egos into a morphing otherness.

They chameleon into
alternatives, become illegible
to themselves

### 5. Screen-Skin

The screen came later.

### 6. Ana-Mendieta

In a retrospective of Ana Mendieta's work: "This exhibition points not necessarily to the injustice or incapacity of a society that has not been willing to include us, but more towards a personal will to continue being 'other.'" — that it may be intentional, that we want this, the way we want a vacation or a hobby. The deepening chasm between my mother's TV congregation and my polycule's public Instagram account even though we hold hands for a week in Paris. Not either or. We're strangers together and my other-ness doesn't negate as much as folds each of my air-borne roots.

### 7. Notice

Notice. You've been drawing
and crossing lines by yourself
See. A landscape of crossings
a quilt of personal trespassings
All yours now
