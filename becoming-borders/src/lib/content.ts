like my funny uncle's sunday jabs

I visited over the last few years.`,

I am embracing the eel

The deepening chasm between my mother's TV congregation and my polycule's public Instagram account even though we hold hands for a week in Paris. Not either or. We're strangers together and my other-ness doesn't negate as much as folds each of my air-borne roots.`,
