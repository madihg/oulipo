like my funny uncle's sunday jabs.
Because I have a Lebanese passport,
I've needed a visa to step into
lands immune to my country.`,

That day, my life line diverged and a new timeline set in. I became the border I did not cross that day.`,

That it may be intentional, that we want this, the way we want a vacation or a hobby. The deepening chasm between my mother's TV congregation and my polycule's public Instagram account even though her and I hold hands for a week in Paris. Not either or. We're strangers together and my other-ness doesn't negate as much as folds each of my airborne roots.`,
