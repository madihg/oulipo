The golden dice are a clue. They're a gift from a man in Palm Springs who says "mother womb" when referring to the pool he inflated and with a stretch of his chin invites people to jump in with him. I remember shyly falling in love while we swam in silence – became twins. As he dries the skin covering his trapezius skin, he explains that the dice are a nod to the masters of uncertainty and I must have been in awe at how Americans turn plastic into story – why else would my clavicles still shiver at the memory of his fingers placing the cheap necklace against them, how they moored me there. I must have shaved my head that week in LA before flying out.
