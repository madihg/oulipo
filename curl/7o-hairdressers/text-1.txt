Tenderloin, San Francisco, 2020 – I had gotten used to nurses gathering around my veins during blood donation runs. They'd point at the blue bulges, speak about them in the third person, hand the needle to their youngest so they could learn. Lily scrunches my hair longer than necessary, sticks a comb into it and marvels at its suspension. I think I hear her breath catch before she starts cutting.
