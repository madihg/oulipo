WHERE DO AGENTS, SKILLS, AND COMMANDS LIVE?
=============================================

Short answer: it depends on scope.

GLOBAL (all your projects, every folder you open)
-------------------------------------------------
Location: ~/.claude/commands/
Currently installed:
  - oulipo-brand.md   → brand identity guardian
  - oulipo-copy.md    → writing voice and copy style

These work anywhere you run Claude Code, not just in the oulipo folder.
If you rename your brand or want these in every project, this is the right place.

PROJECT-SPECIFIC (only this project)
------------------------------------
Location: oulipo/.claude/commands/
Currently installed:
  - newevent.md       → add events to oulipo.xyz
  - ralph-tui-prd.md  → PRD generator (also symlinked from .agents/)

These only activate when you're working inside the oulipo folder.
Good for commands that reference this project's structure, routes, or data.

MULTI-AGENT / CROSS-EDITOR (Claude Code + Cursor + Codex etc.)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Location: oulipo/.agents/skills/
Currently installed:
  - ralph-tui-prd/    → PRD generator
  - ui-ux-pro-max/    → mobile UX & responsive design (15K+ installs)

Installed via `npx skills add`. These get symlinked into each editor's
config folder (.claude/skills/, .cursor/skills/, etc.)

DO THEY ALWAYS NEED TO BE IN THE PROJECT FOLDER?
-------------------------------------------------
No.

- Global commands (~/.claude/commands/) work everywhere.
- Project commands (project/.claude/commands/) only work in that project.
- The .agents/ folder is a cross-editor convention. It lives in the project
  because skills may be project-relevant, but the `--global` flag exists
  for installing skills globally too:

    npx skills add <repo> --skill <name> --global --yes

  Global skills install to ~/.agents/skills/ and are available in all projects.

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
- Keep brand/voice agents GLOBAL (done — they're in ~/.claude/commands/)
- Keep project-specific commands in the PROJECT (newevent stays in oulipo/)
- For skills you want everywhere, reinstall with --global
- The .agents/ folder in your project is fine — it's dotfile hidden and
  gitignored. Think of it like .vscode/ or .cursor/ — config, not content.
