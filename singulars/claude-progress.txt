## Session 26 (Agent - Feature #58): 2026-02-06

### Completed Features
- Feature #58: Data import script loads performances and poems from JSON ✅
  - Ran `node scripts/seed.mjs` (default seed-data.json) — all 5 performances upserted, all 18 poems upserted
  - Ran `node scripts/seed.mjs scripts/seed-data.json` (explicit path) — same result, CLI path argument works
  - Created `scripts/verify-import.mjs` for comprehensive field-by-field verification
  - Queried Supabase directly: 5/5 performances, 18/18 poems match seed data exactly
  - Performance fields verified: name, slug, color, location, date, status, num_poems, num_poets, model_link, huggingface_link, poets
  - Poem fields verified: theme, theme_slug, text, author_name, author_type, performance_id associations
  - Browser verification: /singulars shows all 5 performance cards, /singulars/hard-exe shows all 3 themes with poems
  - Zero console errors, zero mock data patterns in src/
  - Idempotent: re-running script updates existing records without duplicates

### Files Created
- scripts/verify-import.mjs (comprehensive verification script for import results)

## Session 25 (Agent - Feature #54): 2026-02-06

### Completed Features
- Feature #54: Performance dates display correctly (timezone-safe) ✅
  - Verified formatDate() in both page.tsx files uses manual date string parsing
  - Splits "YYYY-MM-DD" string and maps to month names, avoiding UTC timezone shift
  - Fallback uses 'T00:00:00' suffix to force local time interpretation
  - Verified all 5 performances show correct dates:
    - reverse.exe: DB "2025-06-01" → UI "June 1, 2025" ✅
    - hard.exe: DB "2024-11-15" → UI "November 15, 2024" ✅
    - reinforcement.exe: DB "2024-06-20" → UI "June 20, 2024" ✅
    - versus.exe: DB "2024-03-10" → UI "March 10, 2024" ✅
    - carnation.exe: DB "2023-12-01" → UI "December 1, 2023" ✅
  - Verified on both landing page (/singulars) and performance pages (/singulars/[slug])
  - Zero console errors, zero mock data patterns in src/

### Current Status
- Features passing: 54/64 (84.4%)

  - When canVote=true: cursor set to colored filled circle SVG at 20x20px
  - When canVote=false (voted/trained): cursor reverts to 'default'
  - Outside voting area: parent elements use standard cursor ('auto')
  - Tested SVG cursor CSS value via injected test div — works correctly
  - Zero mock data patterns in src/

- Feature #45: CSS consistency with oulipo.xyz design system ✅

### Files Created
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/not-found.tsx (custom 404 for performance pages)
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/[themeSlug]/not-found.tsx (custom 404 for theme pages)
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/[themeSlug]/layout.tsx (layout wrapper for not-found scoping)

- All three assigned features verified with browser automation

### Notes for Next Session
- Next.js 14 requires a layout.tsx at the same level as not-found.tsx for proper scoping

  - Zero console errors

### Current Status
- Features passing: ~28/64 (25 + 3 new)
- Dev server on port 3001
- Next.js dev server has persistent compilation race condition:
  - First request after cache clear often returns 404 from pages router
  - Browser-initiated requests compile correctly; curl after cache clear often fails
  - Fix: retry request or navigate via browser first

### Notes for Next Session
- curl requests to API routes after server restart often 404 due to Next.js compilation race
- Browser-initiated fetch() from rendered pages works reliably
- Test fingerprints used: test_fp_feature18_verify, test_fp_feature28_persist, test_fp_feature33_clean, test_fp_feature33_dblclick

### Files Created
- src/components/MiniVoting.tsx (mini-voting client component with fingerprint voting)

### Files Modified
- src/app/singulars/page.tsx (added MiniVoting import and component below title)
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/[themeSlug]/VotingPoemPair.tsx (show results for trained performances)

### Current Status
- Features passing: ~20/64
- Dev server on port 3001 (needs NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" for stable compilation)
- Next.js 14.2.35 has transient vendor-chunks/tslib webpack cache corruption - resolves on retry
- All data from real Supabase, zero mock data patterns

### Notes for Next Session
- Next.js dev server needs increased memory: NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
- The vendor-chunks/tslib.js error is a known Next.js 14.2 webpack issue - clearing .next and restarting fixes it
- Theme pages may 404 on first compile but work after retry
- The MiniVoting component uses dynamic import for fingerprintjs to avoid SSR issues

## Session 8 (Agent H): 2026-02-06

### Completed Features
- Feature #7: Landing page links to performance pages ✅
  - All 5 performance cards displayed in horizontally scrollable row
  - Non-upcoming cards (hard, reinforcement, versus, carnation) link to /singulars/[slug]
  - reverse.exe (upcoming) card is NOT clickable (wrapped in div, not link)
  - Verified via Playwright: click hard.exe → /singulars/hard-exe, reinforcement.exe → /singulars/reinforcement-exe
  - Zero console errors, no mock data patterns

- Feature #9: Performance page links to theme voting pages ✅
  - Created /singulars/[slug]/[themeSlug]/page.tsx with Supabase data fetching
  - Theme cards on performance page link to full voting page
  - Verified: /singulars/hard-exe/belonging, /loss, /memory all load correctly
  - Each theme page shows theme name, performance info, status badge, two poems
  - Added force-dynamic export to prevent Next.js caching issues
  - Zero console errors

- Feature #14: End-to-end voting workflow on hard.exe (training) ✅
  - Created VotingPoemPair client component with interactive voting
  - Fingerprint-based vote deduplication via localStorage
  - POST /api/vote integration with real Supabase database
  - Updated check-votes API to support poem_ids filtering
  - Post-vote results inline: vote counts, colored dots (performance color)
  - User's own vote visually distinguishable: larger dot + "Your vote" label
  - "Thank you for voting!" confirmation message
  - Verified via Playwright: click poem → POST vote → see results
  - Network confirmed: GET /api/check-votes → POST /api/vote both 200 OK

### Files Created/Modified
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/[themeSlug]/page.tsx (new - theme voting page)
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/[themeSlug]/VotingPoemPair.tsx (new - interactive voting client component)
- src/app/singulars/[slug]/page.tsx (added force-dynamic export)
- src/app/api/check-votes/route.ts (updated to support poem_ids filtering)

### Current Status
- Features passing: ~22/64 (estimated)
- Dev server on port 3001
- Next.js 14 dev server has intermittent 404 on first-request compilation race condition — always works on retry
- Clean .next cache + node_modules/.cache required after HMR corruption

### Notes for Next Session
- After code changes, always clear .next and node_modules/.cache before restart
- Next.js 14.2.35 has webpack cache corruption issues during HMR — first request to new route may 404, second succeeds
- Voting works end-to-end: fingerprint generation → check existing → POST vote → inline results
- Vote dots capped at 50 visual dots, with "+N more" overflow indicator

### Completed Features
- Feature #4: No mock data patterns in codebase ✅
  - Ran all 6 grep checks (globalThis, devStore, mockData, TODO, new Map/Set, mock libraries)
  - All checks returned empty - zero mock data patterns in src/
  - All API routes use real Supabase client (@supabase/supabase-js)

- Feature #5: Backend API queries real Supabase database ✅
  - All API routes use getServiceClient() || getSupabase() for real Supabase queries

  - Verified via both curl and browser automation (Playwright)

### Work Done
- Set up Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Created all API routes: health, performances, performances/[slug], poems, vote, vote-counts
- Updated all API routes to use service client for proper database access
- Seeded database with 5 performances and 18 poems via seed.mjs script
- Removed duplicate next.config.mjs (kept next.config.ts)

### Current Status
- Features passing: #4, #5
- Features in progress by other agents: #1, #2, #3
- Dev server runs on port 3001 (port 3000 occupied by another project)

### Notes for Next Session
- Port 3000 is used by another project (protos-inv). Use port 3001.
- Supabase credentials are in .env.local (not committed to git)
- The anon key returns empty arrays for RLS-protected tables; use service client for API routes
- All 5 performances seeded: reverse.exe (upcoming), hard.exe (training), reinforcement.exe/versus.exe/carnation.exe (trained)
