## Session: 2026-02-06

### Completed Features
- Feature #4: No mock data patterns in codebase ✅
  - Ran all 6 grep checks (globalThis, devStore, mockData, TODO, new Map/Set, mock libraries)
  - All checks returned empty - zero mock data patterns in src/
  - All API routes use real Supabase client (@supabase/supabase-js)

- Feature #5: Backend API queries real Supabase database ✅
  - All API routes use getServiceClient() || getSupabase() for real Supabase queries
  - GET /api/performances returns 5 real performances with UUIDs from Supabase
  - GET /api/performances/hard-exe returns hard.exe with 6 poems and real database IDs
  - No hardcoded arrays or static returns in any API route file
  - Verified via both curl and browser automation (Playwright)

### Work Done
- Set up Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Created all API routes: health, performances, performances/[slug], poems, vote, vote-counts
- Updated all API routes to use service client for proper database access
- Seeded database with 5 performances and 18 poems via seed.mjs script
- Removed duplicate next.config.mjs (kept next.config.ts)

### Current Status
- Features passing: #4, #5
- Features in progress by other agents: #1, #2, #3
- Dev server runs on port 3001 (port 3000 occupied by another project)
- Database is connected and healthy with schema applied

### Notes for Next Session
- Port 3000 is used by another project (protos-inv). Use port 3001.
- Supabase credentials are in .env.local (not committed to git)
- The anon key returns empty arrays for RLS-protected tables; use service client for API routes
- All 5 performances seeded: reverse.exe (upcoming), hard.exe (training), reinforcement.exe/versus.exe/carnation.exe (trained)

## Session 2 (Agent B): 2026-02-06

### Completed Features
- Feature #1: Database connection to Supabase established ✅
  - Health endpoint at /api/health returns 200 with database: "connected"
  - All 3 tables (performances, poems, votes) accessible
  - Zero console errors

- Feature #2: Database schema applied correctly ✅
  - Created /api/schema-check endpoint for deep schema verification
  - All 13 performances columns verified
  - All 9 poems columns verified
  - All 4 votes columns verified
  - FK poems.performance_id→performances.id works (error 23503)
  - FK votes.poem_id→poems.id works (error 23503)
  - Unique index performances(slug) verified
  - Unique index votes(voter_fingerprint, poem_id) verified
  - cast_vote RPC function exists and works

- Feature #3: Data persists across server restart ✅
  - Posted vote with fingerprint "RESTART_TEST_12345" via /api/vote
  - Started new server instance (port 3011) simulating restart
  - Confirmed vote still exists on new server (duplicate detection worked)
  - Cleaned up test data after verification

### Files Created
- src/app/api/schema-check/route.ts (schema verification endpoint)
- scripts/apply-schema.mjs (automated schema deployment)
- .env.local.example (env var template)

### Current Status
- Features passing: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 (all 5 infrastructure features complete!)
- 5/64 features passing (7.8%)
- All infrastructure features verified with browser automation screenshots

## Session 3 (Agent C): 2026-02-06

### Completed Features
- Feature #57: Vote references valid poem_id (referential integrity) ✅
  - POST /api/vote with non-existent UUID poem_id returns HTTP 404 "Poem not found"
  - API validates poem existence before any vote insertion (route.ts lines 51-62)
  - DB-level FK constraint confirmed via schema-check endpoint (error code 23503)
  - No orphaned vote records can be created
  - Verified via curl and browser (Playwright)

- Feature #59: Import script JSON format is documented ✅
  - Added 60-line documentation block to scripts/seed.mjs
  - Documents required fields for performances: name, slug, color, status
  - Documents optional fields: location, date, num_poems, num_poets, model_link, huggingface_link, poets
  - Documents required fields for poems: text, author_name, author_type
  - Documents theme structure: theme, theme_slug, poems array
  - Includes complete inline JSON example with type annotations
  - References scripts/seed-data.json as a working example
  - Notes on idempotency, matching strategy, and status semantics

### Current Status
- Features passing: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #57, #59
- Dev server runs on port 3001
- Database healthy with all constraints verified

### Notes for Next Session
- curl commands require dangerouslyDisableSandbox=true to connect to localhost
- Port 3001 dev server takes ~30s for first compilation
- All FK constraints and unique indexes verified working at DB level
