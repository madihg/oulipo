  <div id="poem">Baby don’t be jealous / you don’t want this either / neither the chip nor the swollen shoulder / the father hemmed in this here womb / you don’t want this body / hurled from a slingshot / into the precipice of life kicking / ticking like a bomb parody / I am dying every minute / and I must / and this is not a competition / and even if I win this cannonball / is ours to hug / and I kissed the bigger toes / of ambition dabbed her temples / with the lips of my eyes / and no one told me I signed a bond / and how heavy the covenant with an immortal dream / and I’d rather build totems with gods my tongue can’t shape / and never bow to myself / Baby don’t be jealous / and I got was plastic citizenship / and a desk in a church of gamblers / and I love you</div>
